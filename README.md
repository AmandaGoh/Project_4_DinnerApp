#User story
Apart from my interest in food and cooking, this project was born out of the daily frustration I had with maintaining a grocery list. Honey what's for dinner allows users to plan meals weekly while helping users avoid the dreadful typing or writing of an ingredient list before hitting the grocer's.

Currently the recipes are provided for by Yummly.
